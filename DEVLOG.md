# Development log

- Initialized standalone layout from the original seed archive; copied reference material into docs/reference.
- Read the PRD, phase plan, architecture, defaults, guardrails, and mobile agent instructions.
- Started baseline dependency installation and independent architecture/mobile reviews.

- Phase 0 baseline: root 48/48 and mobile 312/312 across 29 suites passed. Typechecks passed. Seed Jest reports an open handle after success.

- Phase 1 development API: fake participant routes, hashed scoped sessions, rotating refresh, concurrent idempotency, upstream proxy, fake/OpenAI provider interfaces. 14 provider/API tests and server typecheck passed; browser integration pending.

- Meeting API milestone (phases 6–12): advisor pairing, POWER/gate/Pulse, consent and chunked audio, transcript revisions, coach/facilitator, closing, speaker mapping, sourced proposals, kickoff/setup. Backend 35 tests, typecheck and lint pass; 93.43% line coverage. OpenAPI covers 57 operations with HTTP conformance checks.

- Integrated participant and advisor mobile workflows: deck voice, fallback capture, AnswerCard recovery, versioned Task Cards, Pulse, company pairing, POWER/gate, consent, live session controls, results, speaker review, kickoff and setup.
- Verified strict outgoing advisor request bodies against the proposed OpenAPI schemas; corrected transcript, speaker, consent and notes payload mismatches found by HTTP browser tests.
- Hardened offline logout, company query scoping, role replacement, audio origins/cache cleanup, secure-storage writes and durable retry keys. Added a mock-only guided Demo tour.
- Shared suite now 78 tests and 96.75% executable lines; handsfree/meetings coverage 90% gate passes at 93.15%. CI now runs all package checks, scoped coverage and a mock browser smoke flow.
- Captured phone-size dark/light screenshots and reviewed gallery, Task Cards, plan and sourced results against the supplied design. Device/provider outcomes remain explicitly unverified.

- Final integrated verification: 428 mobile tests across 48 suites, 78 shared tests, 37 API tests; typechecks, lint, web export and pinned-contract regeneration pass. Line coverage: shared 96.75%, handsfree/meetings 93.15%, API 91.26%. Added mobile-local Ajv dev dependencies so contract tests do not rely on another package’s installation order.
- Browser A–I portions are recorded precisely in DEVICE-QA: fake providers/scripted speech only, no native or production claims. Saved 77 phone-size captures and completed the explicit-action demo tour.
